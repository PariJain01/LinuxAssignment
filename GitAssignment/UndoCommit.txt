Here's how to **undo the last commit** or **remove a file from the remote repository** using Git command-line interface (CLI):

---

🔄 Undo the Last Commit (Keep the changes)

**undo the commit but keep the changes in your working directory**:

   bash
    git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Then, if needed, you can make changes and recommit.

---

🔁 Undo the Last Commit (Discard the changes)

**completely remove the commit and discard changes**:

   bash
    git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Then push the change to the remote:

   bash
    git push origin master --force
```

---

---> 🗑️ Remove a File from the Remote Repository

# delete a file that was pushed to GitHub:

Step 1: Remove the file locally

   bash
    git rm unwanted-file.txt
```

### Step 2: Commit the change

   bash
    git commit -m "Removed unwanted-file.txt"
```

Step 3: Push the change to GitHub

   bash
    git push origin master
```

✅You’ve now undone a commit or removed a file from the remote repo via CLI.
