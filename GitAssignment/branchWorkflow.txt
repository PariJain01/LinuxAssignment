🌿 Merge Types: Feature Branch Workflow with Pull Request

✅ Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch

   bash:-

    git checkout -b feature-branch


---

✅ Step 2: Make changes and commit

For example, modify or create a file:

   bash:-

    echo "New feature added." >> feature.txt
    git add feature.txt
    git commit -m "Added new feature in feature-branch"


---

✅ Step 3: Push the branch to GitHub

   bash:-

    git push origin feature-branch


---

✅ Step 4: Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your GitHub repo.
2. GitHub will detect your newly pushed branch and prompt you to "Compare & Pull Request."
3. Click it and review the changes.
4. Submit the Pull Request to merge into the `master` branch.

---

✅ Step 5: Merge the branch

On the PR page:

* Click **“Merge Pull Request”**
* Confirm the merge
* (Optional) Delete the `feature-branch` after merging

---

**Merge Complete!**
You’ve now merged code from a feature branch into `master` using a GitHub pull request, a common DevOps collaboration workflow.
