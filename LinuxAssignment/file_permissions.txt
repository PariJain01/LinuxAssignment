 Step 1: Create a File

   touch permission.txt


Step 2: Check Default Permissions

   ls -l permission.txt 

-Output example:
 
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 May 22 10:00 myfile.txt

//Owner can read & write
//Group can read
//Others can read

 Step 3: Change Permissions Using chmod

  chmod [permissions] [filename]

1. Give full permissions to owner, read/execute to group, and only read to others

chmod 751 permission.txt
Breakdown of 751:

7 (owner) = read (4) + write (2) + execute (1)
5 (group) = read (4) + execute (1)
1 (others) = execute only

2. Remove execute permission for all

  chmod a-x myfile.txt

3. Add execute for owner only
 
  chmod u+x myfile.txt


chmod g+w myfile.txt     # Add write to group
chmod o-r myfile.txt     # Remove read from others
chmod u=rwx myfile.txt   # Set owner to rwx only
